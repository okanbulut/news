I recently had the opportunity to be interviewed by [**The Gateway**](https://thegatewayonline.ca), the official student newspaper of the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html). During the interview, I shared insights on how the growing use of generative AI is shaping teaching and learning activities in education. 

We discussed both the challenges and opportunities that generative AI tools bring to classrooms and explored ways educators can adapt to this rapidly evolving landscape.

Thank you for your continued interest in my work, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!
