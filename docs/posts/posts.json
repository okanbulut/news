In this presentation, Joyce and I will present our ongoing research on the integration of response time with computerized adaptive testing (see the flyer below for further details). The Zoom link for our presentation is https://bit.ly/3EQ7Ole. We look forward to seeing you there!\r\n\r\nRETURN TO THE NEWS PAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
